# Fradulant-Review-Detection
The project intends t o check reviews left by the customers on online platforms for their veracity. It’s purpose is t o separate the untruthful spam from genuine
reviews. The project was implemented through an integrated model, with discrete modules being developed and extensively tested individually before their integration.

Standardization: Pre-processing is applied t o t he input text to standardize the input as per the system’s requirement. The data is tokenized, stopwords removed, lemmatized and finally vectorized t o be fed into the CNN model.


CNN Model: The model made use of the ability of the CNN to extract local features of the provided dataset.

Data Visualisation: The results given by the model are presented in an accessible way to better see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data, so that accurate and relevant conclusions can be drawn from them.
